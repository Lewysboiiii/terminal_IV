Dream Askew gives us 

ruined buildings and wet tarps

nervous faces in the campire glow

strange new psychic powers, 

fierce queer love, 

and turbulent skies above a fledgling community, asking “What do you do next?”


Dream Askew gives us ruined buildings and wet tarps, nervous faces in the campire glow, strange new psychic powers, fierce queer love, and turbulent skies above a fledgling community, asking “What do you do next?”




Terminal_IV gives us riot shields and CCTV, cyberdecks slung low like guitars, jailbroken software on military chrome, AI ghosts in the hard drives of lovers who can't let go, and a community learning to thrive on a chain-link between dead Earth and the promised stars; on the Edge between a society that doesn't want us and a vacuum that doesn't care.

About the station





Once a bridge between 


payloads executed




a sunrise every minute



jailbreaks both kinds

introduces new standards and pushes those who won't give up pn the old way of life to the margins




terminal_IV gives us tear gas and CCTV, spray-paint and liquid propellant, , and an arms race to stay one step ahead of the survaillance state. 

It gives us a society among the stars, 36,000km above the corpse of a dead planet;


 a society hungry to extract life and data, to suck people dry for profit and package up whatever's left to sell. It gives us a world where megastructures on a scale beyond 21st century comprehension play host to familiar 21st century injustices, where the rich divide up the spoils of far-flung asteroids while the marginalised bake in cosmic radiation.

It gives us encryption and firewalls,

trains
zero day exploits 
social engineering


It gives us skyscraper-lined streets under spin gravity curving gently upwards;



computer terminals and nuclear engines glowing bright in the dark; 
trust your comrades implicitly but not every part of them 


bodies that are as much chrome as they are flesh; the uneasy collision between an unprecedented freedom to self-augment and self-express, and the extension of corporate control into the human body itself. It gives us cybernetics that erode the last bastion of privacy, the mind, and scream your secrets out to anyone willing to pay. It gives us the desperate struggle for the right to say "no. I will not be part of this system".   



 Hackers taming the hostile Net as their playground. Chromeheads pushing their bodies to act faster and stronger and more precisely than our flesh and bone have evolved to handle. 

It gives us the chance to rise to the level of legends, to burn brightly and go out with a bang... or maybe even to be the spark that ignites irrevocable change in a system poised to collapse.
