# NAME
treat - tend to a teammate's harm in an emergency

# SYNOPSIS
**treat** [*TEAMMATE*]... [*ACTION*]... [*HARM*]... 

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you take action to give emergency **treatment** to a teammate for a specific **harm**, _then_ the penalty from the harm you treated counts as **one level less severe** for an hour or two. 

# NOTE
This treatment can involve repairs to flesh and chrome, in which case you're probably rolling something like **Engineer**; or hotfixes to software, in which case consider **Interface**; or perhaps you're offering mental support to a teammate who can't go on, in which case look at **Connect**.

If more than one teammate is attending to the patient, consider **leading** a group action to **treat** any number of harms up to the number of participating teammates.

In the case of emergency medical aid, always try to treat a casualty using their own IFAK - they brought one, right? Otherwise, you risk sustaining trauma yourself with your own trauma kit all used up.
