# NAME
assist - help a teammate

# SYNOPSIS
**assist** [*TEAMMATE*]... [*ACTION*]...

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you step up to **assist** a teammate who is taking action, _then_ you mark **1 stress** to add the **boost die** to their roll. You might also suffer any consequences of the action roll, depending on the circumstances.
 
# NOTE
Only one character may assist a given roll. If you really want to help and someone else is already assisting, consider performing a **setup** action instead. 

A character may assist when someone **leads** a group action if they aren't taking part in it directly. You decide which teammate in the group action gets the bonus die.
