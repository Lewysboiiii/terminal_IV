# NAME
lead - coordinate a group action

# SYNOPSIS
**lead** [**-c** *--cohorts*] [**-t** *teammates*] [*PARTICIPANTS*]... [*ACTION*]...

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you coordinate multiple allies to act in concert, _then_ you take the **lead** in a group action. All participants roll; count only the single highest roll as the result of an action roll covering all participants. As the leader, take **1 stress** for each participant who rolled a 1-3 as their best result.

# OPTIONS 
**-c**, **--cohorts**
: Cohorts participate by rolling their quality level. If youâ€™re participating alongside the cohort, roll the appropriate action; otherwise roll an action like **Connect**, **Influence**, **Burn**, etc to direct/ or inspire their efforts.

**-t**, **--teammates**
: Teammates participate by making an action roll (usually everyone rolls the same action). 

# NOTE
Your character doesn't have to be especially skilled at the action at hand in order to lead a group action. This command is about leadership, not necessarily about ability.
